# Inverse Kinematics Implementation Practice

I used VIBE to get Human 3D pose estimation values (sequence of poses) and stored it into pkl file (in vibe_data)
Then, I tried to use inverse kinematics to reconstruct or retarget to the Humanoid joints.

The code will have some misalignment yet, so I will continuously fix it.

## How to run the Inverse Kinematics?
```python
python3 retarget_ik.py
```
